  I'm a front-end developer with a passion for building web experiences that are clean, accessible, and thoughtfully crafted. Over the past decade, I've worked across agencies and diverse projects, mastering React, Vue, JavaScript, TypeScript, and other modern frontend tools while developing a keen eye for component architecture and development best practices. Now I'm seeking to channel that expertise into a product-focused role where I can go deep on a mission-driven product, collaborate closely with a dedicated team, and build something that genuinely improves people's lives.
  
  Beyond the screen, I'm passionate about building community through cycling. As a leader of my local women's cycling club, I create safe, encouraging, and educational spaces for women to ride — whether that's tackling mountain trails or adventuring on gravel roads. I also love snowboarding, cozying up on the couch and getting lost in a good book or a game on my Switch, and finding balance through yoga.
